      <div class='line'>Had those spars groan’d above so fierce a breath</div>
      <div class='line'>Rich with the vapour of the boar. For now</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Set high in the shadow of the wall, and bubbled</div>

      <div class='line'>Of lambs perturb the dusk—bleats shivering out</div>
      <div class='line'>Like wool from thorns—there the young Deirdre stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Even she whose climbing beauty pales the world,</div>

      <div class='line'>Send her across the bog a little cloud</div>
      <div class='line'>Full of the ancient savours, full of peace,</div>

      <div class='line'>O ye that stand in heaven, far removed!</div>

      <div class='line'>That but an hour ago shook with the thud</div>
      <div class='line'>Of racers and of hurlers? Was it late?</div>
      <div class='line'>The wrinkled nurse replied, Had the child eyes?</div>
      <div class='line'>Back from a hosting and a desperate prey</div>
      <div class='line'>For corn and mares and rustless brass and beeves</div>
      <div class='line'>Naois, with the rest of Usnach’s sons,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had come. She had seen him weary go but now</div>
      <div class='line'>Heavily up the steep through the king’s hedge.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now on the hill-top while the woman spoke</div>
      <div class='line'>So chanced it. Hanging on the young man’s lips</div>
      <div class='line'>The hosts sway’d round him, and above the press</div>
      <div class='line'>Connachar, glittering all in torques of gold</div>
      <div class='line'>And writhen armlets, listen’d from the mound</div>
      <div class='line'>Of judgment, by the doom-oak at his door.</div>
      <div class='line'>His beak’d helm took the sunset, but he held</div>
      <div class='line'>His flint-red eyes in shadow and averse.</div>
      <div class='line'>And when before him, dark as a young pine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unmoved the son of Usnach had told all;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>How half his folk had perish’d in the task</div>
      <div class='line'>By plague or battle, and how poor a spoil</div>
      <div class='line'>Was driven home, the king cried, Paragon!</div>
      <div class='line'>We must go griddle cakes in honey for him,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bring lavers of pale gold to wash off blood</div>
      <div class='line'>So precious to us; since for many moons</div>
      <div class='line'>This champion had forsworn the face of softness</div>
      <div class='line'>And stretch’d his hungers to the sleety rock,</div>
      <div class='line'>Call in the smile of women to unlatch</div>
      <div class='line'>From his grim ribs the iron:—Faugh! Away!</div>
      <div class='line'>Let Usnach’s sons take out again that night</div>
      <div class='line'>Their broken clans, their piteous cattle thence;</div>
      <div class='line'>Defeated men should see his gates no more.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The son of Usnach turn’d and went. He ran</div>
      <div class='line'>Down hill and to the loch to wash his wounds</div>
      <div class='line'>Chanting—his dark curls waver’d in the wind—</div>
      <div class='line'>Chanting he strode, tossing a brace of spears,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lest we should think him humbled. Half-way down</div>
      <div class='line'>The shapes of women loiter’d in the dusk</div>
      <div class='line'>And one held backward out her arms to take</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>The latchets of a cloak. But as Naois</div>
      <div class='line'>Pass’d by them, closely as is heard a sigh—</div>
      <div class='line'>His vehement flood of soul fierce for the mere—</div>
      <div class='line'>Glancing not right nor left, O then I saw</div>
      <div class='line'>The foot of Deirdre stricken motionless—</div>
      <div class='line'>I saw the stiff cloak many-colour’d sink</div>
      <div class='line'>Slow to the grass, wrinkling its blazon’d skins</div>
      <div class='line'>Behind her.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>Gloom suck’d in the banqueters;</div>
      <div class='line'>And from the warmth of drinking at his feast</div>
      <div class='line'>Connachar sent forth to the women’s house;</div>
      <div class='line'>And heralds bade bring also the gray seer</div>
      <div class='line'>Cathva, though Cathva had not will’d to come.</div>
      <div class='line'>But hardly had those erranders gone out</div>
      <div class='line'>When rose the door-hide: the gray seer came in</div>
      <div class='line'>Noiseless. He was of fog the night hath spun,</div>
      <div class='line'>Earth in his hair and on his meagre cheek,</div>
      <div class='line'>Consumed and shaking, ragged as seaweed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to the throne he cried: “Why hast thou called</div>
      <div class='line'>Me to carousal? Is this bed my work?</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Nay—too great clearness underneath the thunder</div>
      <div class='line'>Shew’d insupportably the things to be.</div>
      <div class='line'>Too long have I, with glamours, drops and runes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shook round her cabin low my skirts of storm</div>
      <div class='line'>To shield thee from that devastating face.</div>
      <div class='line'>My fault is only that I slew her not.</div>
      <div class='line'>Know! it was I that, seeing those cradled limbs</div>
      <div class='line'>Bright with disaster for the realm and thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>Flung her away among sea-warding mountains.</div>
      <div class='line'>But Muilréa to Ben Gorm said: <em>What is this?</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>What glee is this disturbs our desolation?</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>I hear another than the wild duck sheering</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Sidelong the wind. Tall as a rush is she,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Sweet as the glitter of the netted lakes!</em></div>
      <div class='line'>And Ben Gorm answer’d: <em>We are sick alone:</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Let us distil the heavens into a child:</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Yea, let our bones appear, the black goat starve</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Upon our heads, yet shall this wafted seed</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Superabound with ripeness we forego.</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Dark space shall come to heart—silver of mists—</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>And thou, blue depth of gorges!</em> Connachar,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>I heard the plotters, but I let her live.”</div>
      <div class='line'>And the king ask’d: “Hath any seen her there?”</div>
      <div class='line'>And Cathva answer’d, “Till thy servant found her</div>
      <div class='line'>She knew not that men were.” Then Connachar</div>
      <div class='line'>Commanded yet again: “Bring us in Deirdre.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Straightway a woman like the claw of birds,</div>
      <div class='line'>Decrepit, bright of eye, and innocent,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stood up beyond the fire. Her fingers play’d—</div>
      <div class='line'>Play’d with a red stone at her breast. He ask’d</div>
      <div class='line'>“Who gave thee, hag, the jewel of thy bosom?”</div>
      <div class='line'>Now every drinker from the darkest stalls</div>
      <div class='line'>Perceived the brooch was Deirdre’s, and a gift</div>
      <div class='line'>To her from Connachar. Aghast, the woman</div>
      <div class='line'>Fumbled at her sere breast, and wept and said:</div>
      <div class='line'>“It was a gift to me, O Connachar,</div>
      <div class='line'>This night.” And he, consummate lord of fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our never-counsell’d lord, the Forest-odour’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>That kept about his heart a zone of chill,</div>
      <div class='line'>Smiled, though within the gateway of his fort</div>
      <div class='line'>A surmise crept, as ’neath a load of rushes</div>
      <div class='line'>Creeps in the stabber. “Fix the pin, Levarcham,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>For she that loses such a brooch will grieve.</div>
      <div class='line'>Why comes not Deirdre?” “Sir, she is not yet</div>
      <div class='line'>Duly array’d, and so is loth to come.”</div>
      <div class='line'>O, then, believe me, all the floor was hush,</div>
      <div class='line'>But a mad discordancy like fifes, drums, brasses,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Bondmen of old wars on the winds released—</div>
      <div class='line'>Shook every beam and pillar of the house;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the king said—“Thou hear’st out of the marsh</div>
      <div class='line'>Scream of my stallions mounting on the gale?”</div>
      <div class='line'>And she said “Yea.” “Thou knowest round these walls</div>
      <div class='line'>How many chariots now are tilted up?”</div>
      <div class='line'>And she said “Yea.” “Then, woman, bring with haste</div>
      <div class='line'>Deirdre, thy charge, into this presence now</div>
      <div class='line'>Or limb from limb upon the pleasant grass</div>
      <div class='line'>Those wheels shall parcel thee at dawn.” And she</div>
      <div class='line'>Lifted her hands and closed her eyes and sang,</div>
      <div class='line'>“She will come back, but I, I shall not bring her!</div>
      <div class='line'>O rainbow breathed into the dreadful pine,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Why art thou gone from me? Dearer to me</div>
      <div class='line'>Than the sobbing of the cuckoo to the shore</div>
      <div class='line'>Why art thou gone from me?” She bow’d and wept.</div>
      <div class='line'>And Connachar came from the throne, and grasping</div>
      <div class='line'>As if he felt no heat, the cauldron’s brims</div>
      <div class='line'>Lean’d through its steams, watching the nurse and said,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Will these afflicting tears bring Deirdre in?”</div>
      <div class='line'>But she look’d up and said: “How shall I bring her?</div>
      <div class='line'>Look now outside thy door, O Connachar!</div>
      <div class='line'>The black oak with the vision-dripping boughs</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose foot is in thy fathers’ blood of pride</div>
      <div class='line'>Stagger’d as I came up in the night-blast.</div>
      <div class='line'>In vain it stretches angers to the sky:</div>
      <div class='line'>It cannot keep the white moon from escape</div>
      <div class='line'>To sail the tempest; nor, O king, canst thou!”</div>
      <div class='line'>The cheek of him that listen’d grew thrice-pale</div>
      <div class='line'>And his thick nostrils swell’d, his half-shut eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Fang’d sheen, and slow dilated; stubbornly</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>He clutch’d to steady his convulsive frame</div>
      <div class='line'>The sea-full cauldron; quick, with efforts vast,</div>
      <div class='line'>Upheaved and swung and pillar’d it on high—</div>
      <div class='line'>And hoarsely bade “Take torches.” Every man</div>
      <div class='line'>Kindled in silence at the hearth divine.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then Connachar pour’d out upon the blaze</div>
      <div class='line'>The flood within the vat. The roofs were fill’d</div>
      <div class='line'>With darkness foul, with hissings and with smoke....</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Of grey trees, to the babble of enchantments</div>

      <div class='line'>Over coast, forest, and bethunder’d crag</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Night—mother of despairs, who proves the steel</div>

      <div class='line'>Uneyed, alone—diffusing her wide veils</div>
      <div class='line'>Bow’d from the heavens to his exultant ear:</div>

      <div class='line in2'>From the house of hostage in some citadel</div>
      <div class='line'>Of hostages lifting up their agony</div>
      <div class='line in2'>After the land they must remember well,</div>

      <div class='line'>O vein of life, lie still!” But Deirdre ran</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Like the moon through brakes, and saw where nought had been</div>
      <div class='line in2'>On the vague shore what seem’d a stone that stood;</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Like the worn pillar of Cenn Cruaich the God.</div>

<p class='c017'><cite>Deirdre Wed.</cite> This episode of thirty hours, delivered by
the Three Voices, does not occur in any of the versions of
the famous “Tragical tale of the Sons of Usnach.” But the
manner of Deirdre’s wooing of Naois is based on an incident
in a Gaelic version of that tale, in which, on a day (not her
marriage day) Deirdre and her women companions “were
out on the hillock behind the house enjoying the scene and
drinking in the sun’s heat. What did they see coming but
three men a-journeying. Deirdre was looking at the men
that were coming, and wondering at them. When the men
neared them, Deirdre remembered the language of the huntsmen
and she said to herself that these were the three sons of
Usnach, and that this was Naois, he having what was above
the bend of his two shoulders above the men of Erin all.”
The three brothers went past without taking any notice of
them, and without even glancing at the young girls on the
hillock. “What happened but that love for Naois struck the
heart of Deirdre, so that she could not but follow after him.
She trussed her raiment and went after the three men that
went past the base of the knoll, leaving her women attendants
there. Aillean and Ardan had heard of the women that
Connachar, King of Ulster, had with him, and they thought
that if Naois their brother saw her he would have her himself,
more especially as she was not married to the king.”
They perceived the woman coming and called on one another
to hasten their steps as they had a long distance to travel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>and the dusk of night was coming on. They did so. She
cried three times “Naois, son of Usnach, wilt thou leave
me?” “What cry is that which it is not well for me to
answer, and not easy for me to refuse?” Twice the brothers
put him off with excuses. “But the third time Naois and
Deirdre met, and Deirdre kissed Naois three times and a
kiss to each of his brothers.” All other incidents in the
episodic poem <em>Deirdre Wed</em> are new.</p>

<p class='c015'><em>Fintan</em>; <em>Urmael</em>; <em>Cir</em>. These were old bards. I have
myself found and explored a tomb like that of Cir, caverned
through a hill-ridge, not far from Eman and Armagh, just
as it is described in the poem. But the curious may rediscover
it for themselves.</p>

<p class='c015'><em>Connachar.</em> This king, or terrestrial divinity, is generally
known as Conchobar, or Conor, King of Ulster (Uladh) and
Arch-King of Ireland. He is chronicled as reigning about
the time of the Incarnation of Christ.</p>

<p class='c015'><em>Eman</em>, or Emain Macha, was the chief palace of Connachar.
It is still seen and named in the “Navan Ring”—enormous
earthworks on a hill about two miles west of Armagh. The
people from the town and country side still go up to dance
there on holidays. Traces of the Lake of Pearls—where
jewels were cast in on a sudden flight, lie in a marsh under
Eman. The <em>Callan</em>, or “loud-sounding” river, runs not very
far off.</p>

<p class='c015'><em>Dun Aengus.</em> A prehistoric stone fortress—singularly
vast—on the edge of the cliffs of Arran Môr, an island in
the Atlantic, west of Galway. The walls are very massive,
and lie half-circle-wise, as if half had broken off and fallen
into the sea.</p>
